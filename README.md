# Pokemonbattleground
For siliconmaze question
This is for the pokemon battle simulator 

I have used nodejs and react for this web application 
to run this application 
download the files seperately from this repo and then using the commands for react create a new project and input the code


For Front end install these dependencies
npx create-react-app pokemon-battle-simulator
cd pokemon-battle-simulator
npm install axios

For Backend ? server.js Install these 
npm init -y
npm install express cors body-parser

after getting all libraries and the files 

run these
node server.js (in the server directory)
npm start
